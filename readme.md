# Minesweeper in Python
My inplementation of [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)) in [Python](https://www.python.org/) using [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

## Quick start
- tested on Windows 10 64-bit with Python 3.9.5 and listed requriments

**First run**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 then in 'src' folder

```bash
python main.py
```
 or just double click it

 - it uses "Comic Sans MS" font so you need to have it installed or change it in code

 **'RUNNABLE' with many bugs and almost no features**
 **Read [about.md](https://github.com/RealTigerCZ/minesweeper/blob/master/about.md)**

 ## Goals:
 - [x] Click highlighing and canceling
 - [x] Advanced clicking controls
 - [x] Gameplay - so you can win and lose (in some sence)
 - [x] Restart button (in some sence)
 - [ ] Actual game loop
 - [ ] Displays - missing bombs, timer, ...
 - [ ] Menu and 'Welcome screen'
 - [ ] Settings
