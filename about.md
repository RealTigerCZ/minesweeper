## Known bugs (many):
- in corners grid lines sometimes are not rendered to the absolute end
- grid lines are not positioned perfectly -> tiles are not rendered in
the middle

## Features:
- it should work on Windows 10 64-bit with Python 3.9.5 (maybe i newer) and [requirements](https://github.com/RealTigerCZ/minesweeper/blob/master/requirements.txt)
- you can turn it off
- its somewhat resizable and should work with other resolutions
- you can edit constants in code (in data classes and main loop)

## Missing features:
- gameplay (yea it does not have any gameplay, you cant win or lose, you can only run it, click on tiles ale restart it)
- lots of other thing like settings, proper menu etc.
